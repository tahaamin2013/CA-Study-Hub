        <p>
          This chapter presents the historical development of atomic theory to
          the modern atomic model. One of the basic concepts of atomic structure
          is atomic number and mass number, which define an element and its
          isotopes. Understanding the structure of atoms is essential to
          understanding many scientific phenomena.

        <p>
          The concept of the atomic model evolved over time as our understanding
          of atomic structure deepened through experimental observations and
          theoretical advances. Several important models of the atom had been
          proposed throughout history, each contributing to the understanding of
          atomic behavior and properties. The most important atomic models are:

          Dalton&apos;s Model
        </h3>
        <p>
          In 1803, the British chemist John Dalton presented a scientific theory
          on the existence and nature of matter. This theory is called
          Dalton&apos;s atomic theory. Main postulates of his theory are as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            All elements are composed of tiny indivisible particles called
            atoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Atoms of a particular element are identical. They have the same mass
            and same volume.
          </li>
          <li>
            During chemical reaction, atoms combine or separate or re-arrange.
            They combine in simple ratios.
          </li>
          <li>Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Dalton was able to explain quantitative results that scientists of his
          time had obtained in their experiments. He nicely explained the laws
          of chemical combinations. His brilliant work became the main stimulus
          for the rapid progress of chemistry during the nineteenth century.
          However, a series of experiments that were performed in the 1850s and
          the beginning of the twentieth century clearly demonstrated that an
          atom is divisible and consists of subatomic particles, electrons,
          protons, and neutrons.

          Rutherford&apos;s Experiment
        </h3>
        <p>
          In 1911, Rutherford performed an experiment to know the arrangement of
          electrons and protons in atoms. Rutherford bombarded a very thin gold
          foil about 0.00004 cm thickness with alpha particles. He used alpha
          particles obtained from the disintegration of polonium. Alpha
          particles are helium nuclei that are doubly positively charged (He
          <sup>2+</sup>). Most of these particles passed straight through the
          foil. Only a few particles were slightly deflected. But one in 1
          million was deflected through an angle greater than 90° from their
          straight paths. Rutherford performed a series of experiments using
          thin foils of other elements. He observed similar results from these
          experiments.
        </p>
        <p>Rutherford made the following conclusions:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            Since the majority of the alpha particles passed through the foil
            undeflected, most of the space occupied by an atom must be empty.
          </li>
          <li>
            The deflection of a few alpha particles through angles greater than
            90° shows that these particles are deflected by electrostatic
            repulsion between the positively charged alpha particles and the
            positively charged part of the atom.
          </li>
          <li>Massive alpha particles are not deflected by electrons.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          On the basis of conclusions drawn from these experiments, Rutherford
          proposed a new model for an atom. He proposed a planetary model
          (similar to the solar system) for an atom. An atom is a neutral
          particle. The mass of an atom is concentrated in a very small dense
          positively charged region. He named this region as the nucleus. The
          electrons are revolving around the nucleus in circles. These circles
          are called orbits. The centrifugal force due to the revolution of
          electrons balances the electrostatic force of attraction between the
          nucleus and the electrons.

          Defects in Rutherford&apos;s Atomic Model
        </h3>
        <p>
          Rutherford&apos;s model of an atom resembles our solar system. It has
          the following defects:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            Classical physics suggests that an electron being a charged particle
            will emit energy continuously while revolving around the nucleus.
            Thus, the orbit of the revolving electron becomes smaller and
            smaller until it would fall into the nucleus. This would collapse
            the atomic structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the revolving electron emits energy continuously, it should form
            a continuous spectrum.
          </li>
        </ol>

          Bohr&apos;s Atomic Theory
        </h3>
        <p>
          In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a model for an atom that was consistent
          with Rutherford&apos;s model. But it also explains the observed line
          spectrum of the hydrogen atom. Main postulates of Bohr&apos;s atomic
          theory are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            The electron in an atom revolves around the nucleus in one of the
            circular orbits. Each orbit has a fixed energy. So each orbit is
            also called an energy level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The energy of the electron in an orbit is proportional to its
            distance from the nucleus. The farther the electron is from the
            nucleus, the more energy it has.
          </li>
          <li>
            The electron revolves only in those orbits for which the angular
            momentum of the electron is an integral multiple of ℎ/2π where ℎ is
            Planck&apos;s constant (its value is 6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J.s).
          </li>
          <li>
            Light is absorbed when an electron jumps to a higher energy orbit
            and emitted when an electron falls into a lower energy orbit.
            Electron present in a particular orbit does not radiate energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            The energy of the light emitted is exactly equal to the difference
            between the energies of the orbits. ΔE = E<sub>2</sub> - E
            <sub>1</sub>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Bohr model does not depict the three-dimensional aspect of an atom.

          Quantum Mechanical Model
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is the current model used by modern science to describe the
          structure of the atom. It incorporates the principles of quantum
          mechanics and treats electrons as wave-particle entities. Instead of
          exact orbits, it defines probability distributions known as orbitals
          where electrons are likely to be found.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quantum mechanical model explains many phenomena that could not be
          explained by earlier models, such as the distribution of electrons in
          atoms and their arrangement in energy levels and sublevels.
        </p>

          Limitations of Atomic Models
        </h3>
        <p>
          All models of the atom have limitations. The Rutherford model could
          not explain why electrons do not spiral into the nucleus. Bohr&apos;s
          model accurately described hydrogen spectra but failed for more
          complex atoms. The quantum mechanical model, while successful in
          explaining many observations, is complex and involves probability
          rather than definitive paths for electrons.
