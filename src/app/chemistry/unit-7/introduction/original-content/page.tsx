      Oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) are fundamental chemical processes that play a crucial role in a variety of natural phenomena and industrial applications. This chapter examines the ammalities beties, forest fires, and the filetabsuch as the rusting of iron objects, the burning of fuel in car importance of redox read the metabolism of food in human the addition, the importance redox reactions in the production of electricity in batter bodies. In decolorization of sub chemicals is discousehold bleaches, and in the industrial production of discussed.
