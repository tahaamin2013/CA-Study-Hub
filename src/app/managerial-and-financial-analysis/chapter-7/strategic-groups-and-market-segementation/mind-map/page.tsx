* 4.2 Strategic Space
** Strategic Groups
*** Companies in an industry are categorized into strategic groups
*** Analysis of these groupings reveals a strategic space
** Strategic Space
*** A gap in the market unoccupied by any strategic group
*** Opportunity for a company to make a strategic initiative
*** Filling this space can provide a competitive advantage
** Example: Price v. Quality
*** Identification of strategic groups using price and quality classification
**** Some firms offer lower-priced, lower-quality products
**** Some firms offer higher-priced, higher-quality products
*** Strategic groups in a market can be mapped by price and quality
**** Four strategic groups emerge based on price and quality positioning
**** Group 2 is the largest, offering middle-range price and middle-range quality
*** Identifying strategic spaces
**** Strategic space appears where no firms currently operate
**** Possible gaps in the market can be targeted strategically
**** Example strategies:
***** Offering a high-quality product at a low price
***** Introducing even higher-quality products at an even higher price
***** Filling the gap between Group 1 and Group 2
