* Competition Analysis
** Importance of Competition Analysis
*** Strategic Position Analysis
*** Assessing Strength of Competition
**** Understanding factors that make competition weak or strong
*** Monitoring Major Competitors
**** Essential for obtaining competitive advantage
**** Knowing competitors' activities

** Porter's Five Forces Model
*** Framework for Analysing Market Competition Strength
*** Not for analysing individual competitors
*** Not for assessing performance differences among firms

** Profitability and Competition
*** Explains Profitability Differences Among Industries
**** Some industries generate higher profits than others
*** Relationship Between Competition and Profitability
**** Stronger competition leads to lower profits

** Factors Affecting Profitability (Porter’s Argument)

* The Five Forces
** Michael Porter (‘Competitive Strategy’) identified five factors or ‘forces’ that determine the strength and nature of competition in an industry or market.
** Threats from Potential Entrants
** Threats from Substitute Products or Services
** Bargaining Power of Suppliers
** Bargaining Power of Customers
** Competitive Rivalry Within the Industry or Market

* Competition Impact
** Strong Competition
*** Firms must supply at competitive prices
*** Cannot charge excessive prices or make supernormal profits
*** Must compete through extra value (higher quality, faster delivery)

* Effect of Strong Forces
** High competition leads to low profitability
** Strategic managers use analysis to choose markets and industries

* Threat from Potential Entrants
** Competition Increase
*** New entrants attracted by high profits
*** Aim to establish a profitable market share
*** Compete on price by charging lower prices
** Significance of Threat
*** Depends on ease or difficulty of market entry
*** High entry cost: Requires investment in assets and facilities
*** Low entry cost: Easier for new entrants to enter
** Barriers to Entry
*** Low Barriers
**** Easy market entry
**** Existing firms keep prices low
**** Strong competition, low profit margins
*** High Barriers
**** Difficult market entry
**** Less pressure on existing firms to lower costs
**** Higher profit margins
left side
** Factors Creating High Barriers
*** Economies of Scale
**** Large firms have lower average costs
**** New entrants face higher costs
*** Capital Investment Requirements
**** Large investment in assets needed
**** High investment risk deters new firms
*** Access to Distribution Channels
**** Limited number of distribution outlets
**** Difficult access raises barriers
*** Time to Become Established
**** Branding importance in some industries
**** High time and cost to establish
*** Know-how
**** Expensive and time-consuming to acquire
*** Switching Costs
**** High costs for buyers to switch suppliers
**** Difficult for new entrants to attract customers
*** Government Regulation
**** Licensing or registration requirements
**** Industry regulations restrict new entrants

* Threat from Substitute Products
** Definition
*** Customers can switch fairly easily to alternative products.
** Examples
*** Domestic Heating Systems
**** Gas-fired
**** Oil-fired
**** Electricity-fired
*** Transport
**** Air transport
**** Rail transport
**** Road transport
*** Food and Drink Products
**** Coffee
**** Tea
** Impact
*** Firms must make products more attractive than substitutes.
*** Increased competition when threat from substitutes is high.
** Variability Over Time
*** Plastic containers replaced glass containers.
*** Synthetic fibers replaced natural fibers (e.g., wool, cotton).
*** Word processors and personal computers replaced typewriters.

* Bargaining Power of Suppliers
** High Supplier Power
*** Suppliers charge high prices
*** Buyers unable to pass costs to customers
*** Low industry profitability
*** Increased market competition
** Ways Suppliers Exert Power
*** Raising prices
*** Reducing quality of goods/services
*** Squeezing industry profitability
*** Industry unable to recover costs
** Factors Affecting Supplier Power
*** Importance of the product supplied
**** Essential components (e.g., car engines) → High power
**** Less critical components (e.g., car mirrors) → Low power
** Example: Bargaining Power of Suppliers
*** Personal Computer Industry
**** Software suppliers (e.g., Microsoft) have high power
**** Manufacturers cannot fully pass high costs to customers
**** Low profit margins in PC manufacturing
*** Automobile Industry
**** Engine manufacturers (e.g., Bosch, Cummins) have high power
**** Car brands depend on key components (e.g., batteries from CATL, Panasonic)
**** Mirror manufacturers have less power due to many suppliers
*** Smartphone Industry
**** Chip suppliers (e.g., Qualcomm, TSMC) have strong power
**** Limited high-end chip manufacturers force brands to accept high costs
**** Screen suppliers (e.g., Samsung for OLED displays) have bargaining power
** Situations Where Supplier Power is Strong
*** Few suppliers in the market
**** Example: Intel and AMD dominate the CPU market
*** No substitutes available for supplied products
**** Example: Boeing and Airbus dominate the aircraft supply industry
*** Suppliers offer differentiated or superior products
**** Example: Nvidia’s dominance in GPU technology
*** Supplier’s product is crucial for the final product
**** Example: Lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles (Tesla, Rivian)
*** Industry is not an important customer for suppliers
**** Example: Small clothing brands vs. large fabric suppliers
*** Suppliers can integrate forward and become competitors
**** Example: Apple manufacturing its own chips (M1, M2) instead of relying on Intel

* Bargaining Power of Customers
** Buyers reduce profitability when they have high buying power
*** Demand lower prices
*** Demand improved product specifications
*** Make rival firms compete to supply
** Example: Supermarkets in the UK
*** Force down prices from suppliers
*** Threaten to switch suppliers
*** Low profit margins in manufacturing industries
** Situations of High Buyer Power (Porter’s Factors)
*** High purchase volume relative to supplier size
*** Products of rival suppliers are undifferentiated
*** Low switching costs between suppliers
*** High cost proportion in buyer’s total costs
*** Low buyer profitability
*** Buyer’s product quality not significantly affected
*** Buyer has full information on suppliers and prices

* Competitive Rivalry
** Determined by Rivalry Between Competitors
*** Strong competition forces firms to offer low prices relative to product quality
*** Keeps profitability fairly low
** Porter’s Conditions for Strong Rivalry
*** Similar Size and Economic Strength
**** When rival firms are of roughly the same size and economic strength
*** Many Competitors
**** When there are many competitors in the industry
*** Slow Market Growth
**** When there is only slow growth in sales demand
*** Undifferentiated Products
**** When products of rival firms are largely the same
*** High Fixed Costs
**** Firms still make some contribution to profit even when they cut prices
*** Large Incremental Supply Capacity
**** Supply capacity can only be increased in large increments
**** Example: Electricity supply industry requiring a new power generation unit
*** High Exit Costs
**** Unprofitable companies are reluctant to leave the market
