* Boston Consulting Group matrix (BCG matrix)
** Developed by Boston Consulting Group for strategic planning
** Helps in selecting optimal strategies for products/business units
** Ensures strategies align with corporate objectives
** Assists in allocation of funds to different products/business units
** Structure
*** 2 Ã— 2 matrix
*** One side: Market growth rate
*** Other side: Market share held by product/business unit
** Market Growth
*** Mid-point often set at 10% per year
*** Above 10% = High growth
*** Below 10% = Low growth
** Market Share
*** Measured as product sales relative to biggest competitor
*** Mid-point = Sales equal to biggest competitor
*** High relative market share = Market leader
*** Low relative market share = Not market leader
** Representation in Matrix
*** Products/business units represented as circles
*** Size of circle = Sales value
left side
** Four Categories of Products/Business Units
*** Question Mark (Problem Child)
**** Low market share in high-growth market
**** Opportunity to increase market share but requires investment
**** Strategic choices:
***** Invest heavily to grow market share
***** Maintain small but profitable position
***** Withdraw due to negative cash flow
**** Small market share is risky as larger firms have cost advantages
*** Star
**** High market share in high-growth market
**** Market leader but requires continuous investment
**** Initially cash-consuming but should become self-financing
**** Eventually earns high returns
*** Cash Cow
**** High market share in low-growth or declining market
**** Market leader, generating strong cash inflows
**** Benefits from economies of scale and efficiency
**** Other companies unlikely to attack due to market stagnation
**** Provides cash for investment in Question Marks and Stars
*** Dog
**** Low market share in low-growth or declining market
**** Unlikely to gain market share due to market leader dominance
**** Often unprofitable, may require closure
**** Strategic choices:
***** Immediate withdrawal or sale (e.g., management buyout)
***** Continue for short-term cash flow before exiting
***** Not advisable to invest more in Dogs

* BCG Model Weaknesses
** Criticisms of the BCG Model
*** Assumptions may be incorrect
**** Competitive strength depends on market share
***** A product can have a strong position despite low market share
***** Factors like quality, brand, and cost impact competitiveness
***** Example: Porsche earns high profits despite low market share
**** Market attractiveness depends on sales growth
***** Companies might benefit from investing in low-growth markets
*** Other influential factors
**** Strength of competition
**** Cost base
**** Brand strength
*** Market definition challenges
**** Geographical scope issues
***** Market could be national, regional, or global
**** Identifying competing products
***** Car market segmentation example
***** Difficulty in categorizing models
*** Better suited for SBUs and segments
**** Not ideal for entire markets
**** Markets have multiple segments
*** Difficulty in defining high/low rates
**** Growth rate ambiguity
**** Market share classification issues
*** Careful interpretation required
**** Impact on R&D and marketing
**** Small changes in growth rate may lead to incorrect decisions
