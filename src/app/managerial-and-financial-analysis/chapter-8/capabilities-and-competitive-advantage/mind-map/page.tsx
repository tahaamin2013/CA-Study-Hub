* Cost Efficiency and Strategic Capability
** Definition
*** Achieving competitive advantage over rivals
*** Competitive advantage through value addition or cost reduction
** Cost Efficiency (Accounting)
*** Minimizing costs through control over spending
*** Efficient use of resources
** Strategic Cost Efficiency
*** Continually reducing costs over time
*** Key requirement for strategic success
*** Described as a ‘threshold strategic capability’
** Achieving Cost Efficiency
*** Better use of resources or lower-cost resources
*** Improving competencies and capabilities
**** Example: Improving inventory management systems
** Economies of Scale
*** Reducing costs by producing or operating at higher volumes
*** Spreading fixed costs over a larger volume of output
*** Result: Lower average cost per unit
*** Large entities benefit more from economies of scale
** Economies of Scope
*** Reducing costs by producing multiple products
*** Entities that produce multiple products achieve lower costs per unit
*** Compared to competitors producing only one product

            * Economies of Scale and Scope
** Economies of Scale
*** Example: Company A vs Company B (Construction Companies)
**** Company A is smaller than Company B
**** Company B has a large market share due to lower-cost houses
** How Company B Achieves Lower Costs
*** Bulk purchasing of raw materials (e.g., bricks, windows)
*** Better use of specialized workers' time
*** Purchasing own construction equipment instead of renting
** Economies of Scope
*** Example: Company C vs Company D and E (Curtains and Carpets)
**** Company C produces both curtains and carpets
**** Competes with Company D (curtains only) and Company E (carpets only)
*** Cost efficiencies of producing both products
*** Company C has a competitive edge over Companies D and E
** Cost Efficiency as a Strategic Capability
*** Achieving cost leadership through cost efficiency
*** Strategic capability provides competitive advantage
