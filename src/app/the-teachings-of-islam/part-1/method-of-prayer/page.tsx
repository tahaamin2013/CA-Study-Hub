              <p>The method of performing salaah is:</p>
              
              <div className="space-y-2 pl-4">
                <p>After performing wuduu&apos;, stand upright facing the Qiblah at a clean place, dressed in neat and clean clothes.</p>
                
                <p>Then say niyyah (intention), raise both hands up to the ears and say Allaahu akbar, then cross them on the belly below the navel.10 Put the right hand on top of the left one.</p>
                
                <p>Do not look hither and thither while saying prayers.11 Stand with respect and full attention to Allah.</p>
                
                <p>After crossing the hands, recite thana, then ta-&apos;awwudh and tasmiyah. Then recite al-Faatihah. After finishing al-Faatihah, say softly &ldquo;aameen.&ldquo; Then recite another surah that you know.</p>
                
                <p>Then say Allaahu akbar and bow for ruku&apos;. In the ruku&apos;, catch hold of the knees with your hands and say the tasbeeh for ruku&apos; three or five times. Then, saying tasmee&apos;a stand upright again and also say tahmeed.</p>
                
                <p>Then, saying takbeer, prostrate for sajdah. Put your knees on the ground first, then hands and then place your nose and then forehead on the ground. Say tasbeeh of sajdah three or five times. Then say takbeer and get up and sit upright. Sit for a few moments and then say takbeer and perform the second sajdah in the same way.</p>
                
                <p>Then say the takbeer again and stand up without putting your hands on the ground.</p>
                
                <p>This is one complete rak&apos;ah and the next one begins. After tasmiyah, recite al-Faatihah again and add another surah. Then perform ruku&apos;, qaumah (standing up), and the two sajdah. Get up and sit upright from the second sajdah and recite tashah-hud, then darood shareef and du&apos;a and then perform the salaam – first turning your face to the right and then towards the left. Two rak&apos;aat have been completed.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>After the salaam, recite the du&apos;a:</p>
          
          <div className="text-center space-y-4 my-8">
            <p className="text-xl italic">Allaahum-ma an-tas-salaamu wa min-kas-salaamu, tabaarak-ta yaa dhal-jalaali wal-ikraam</p>
            
            <p>O Allah! You are the bestower of peace, and from You comes peace. Blessed are You, O Lord of Glory and Honor.</p>
            
            <p>Our Lord! Grant us the good of this world and the good of the Hereafter and save us from the torment of the hell-fire.12</p>
          </div>

          <p>For du&apos;a, raise your hands up, but do not raise them too high. They should not be above the shoulders. After finishing du&apos;a, rub both hands over your face.</p>

          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <span className="font-bold">A.</span>
            <p>Have your right foot upright with its toes facing qiblah and lay down the left foot and sit on it. Both the hands should rest on the knees while sitting so.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <span className="font-bold">Q.</span>
            <span>Is there any difference between the salaah of the imaam,
munfarid (one praying alone) or muqtadi (one following the
imaam) ?</span>
          </div>
          
          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <span className="font-bold">A.</span>
            <p>Yes, there is a little difference. That is that the imaam and
munfarid recite thana, ta‘awwudh, tasmiyah and do qiraa’at
in the first rak’ah. In the second rak’ah, they recite tasmiyah,
al-Faatihah and another surah.
But the muqtadi says only thana in the first rak’ah and after
that he stands silent in all the rest.
Another difference is that after ruku’ the imaam and
munfarid say “Sami ‘al-laahu li man hamidah.” While the
munfarid can also say the tahmeed as well, the muqtadi only
says the tahmeed</p>

          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <span className="font-bold">Q.</span>
            <span>How to offer salaah of 3 or 4 rak’aat?</span>

          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <span className="font-bold">A.</span>
            <p>
              The first two rak’aat should be said in the same way as explained above. And in the qa’ada (sitting), darood shareef
              should not be recited after tashah-hud. Instead, stand up saying takbeer. 
              If the salaah is waajib, sunnah or nafl, then in the following rak’ah recite tasmiyah, al-Faatihah, and another surah. If it is a fard salaah, then in the third and fourth rak’aat only al-Faatihah but not another surah should be recited.
              Complete the three or four rak’aat and then sit in the qa’da and recite tashah-hud, darood, and du’a and then say salaam, ending the three or four rak’aat.

          <div className="flex gap-2">
            <span className="font-bold">A.</span>
            <p>No. Sunnah and nafl salaah are said in units of two or four rak’aat, never three.</p>

            <p>
              For ruku’, the head and waist should be on the same level. The head should neither be higher nor lower than the waist-line, and both the hands should be kept away from the ribs and the knees held tightly.

              Sajdah should be done in such a way that the palms rest on the ground, the wrist and elbows are raised from the ground. The abdomen should not touch the thighs. The hands should be kept away from the ribs also.
