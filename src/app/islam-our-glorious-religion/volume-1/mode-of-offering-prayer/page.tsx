                    Having performed Wudu and put on a pure and clean dress, one
                    should stand upright at a clean place orientating himself
                    towards the Prayer Dircetion (Qiblah) with his feet about
                    four toes apart. He should express intention – by heart as
                    well as by tongue - for whichever prayer he has to offer. He
                    should raise his hands upto the ear-lobes in such a way that
                    the palms face the Qiblah and the fingers remain in their
                    normal condition (neither separated nor close together) and
                    then bring them down saying "Allah-o-Akbar" and put them
                    below his navel. The right hand should be placed on the
                    wrist of the left hand with the thumb and the little finger
                    encircling the wrist and the remaining three fingers resting
                    on it. Now recite "Sanaa" (Subhaanak-Allahomma wa Bi-Hamdeka
                    wa Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta'aalaa Jadduka Walaaa Ilaaha Ghairuk)
                    followed by "Ta'awuz" (A'oozu Billaahi Minash Shaietaa-nir
                    Rajeem) and "Tasmiyah"(Bism-Allah irRahmaan irRaheem). Then
                    recite "Surah Faateha" (say Ameen at the end of it in a low
                    voice) followed by any Surah or three small verses. After
                    this he should go into "Rukoo" saying "Allah-o-Akbar" i.e.
                    bow down placing hands on the knees with the fingers
                    well-spread thereon and grasp the knees. The back and the
                    head should be straight in level and the eyes pinned on to
                    the toes. In this posture say "Subhaana Rabbi-yal Azeem"
                    (Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great) at least three times
                    and stand erect reciting "Tasmeey"(Sami 'Allaahu Liman
                    Hamedah) and also say "Tahmeed" (Allaa-humma Rabbanaa wa
                    Lakal-Hamd or Rabbanaa Lakal Hamd) and then go into "Sajdah"
                    i.e. prostrate in such a manner that first the knees should
                    be placed on the ground then the hands and thereafter the
                    nose and the forehead be placed firmly between both the
                    hands. The arms should be off the sides, the belly away from
                    the thighs and the thighs apart from the calves. All the
                    toes of both the feet should be set firmly on the ground
                    facing the Qiblah. Palms should rest on the ground with the
                    fingers pointing towards the Qiblah. In this position say
                    "Subhaana Rabbi-yal 'Alaa" (Glory be to my Lord, the Most
                    High) three or five times. Then he should rise reciting
                    "Takbeer" and sit in "Jalsah" i.e. first raise his head,
                    then the hands and then sit upright with his left foot under
                    him and the right foot in a vertical position, resting on
                    the insides of the toes facing Qibla. He should put his
                    palms on the thighs near the knees with fingers facing the
                    Qibla. Now he should perform second "Sajdah" reciting
                    "Takbeer" in the same way as the first one. After having
                    observed the second Sajdah he should rise, putting his
                    weight on the front portion of the feet and placing hands on
                    the knees, and stand erect. Do not place hand(s) on the
                    ground for support except for any disability. Now, he is in
                    second Rak'ah. He should recite Tasmiyah, Surah Faateha
                    followed by any other Surah and then perform Rukoo and
                    Sujood like that of the first Rak ah and observe "Qa'adah"
                    i.e. sit spreading the left foot under him and the right
                    foot in vertical position on the pattern of "Jalsah" and
                    recite "Tashah'hud" and when he reaches the word "Laa" raise
                    the index finger of the right hand. To do this, join the
                    middle finger with the thumb to make a circle with the
                    little and ring fingers bent towards the palm; then lower
                    the index finger whilst uttering "Illal Laahu" and then let
                    all the fingers rest straight like that of the left hand,
                    followed by Durood Shareef and Du&apos;aa. And then say "Salaam"
                    i.e. "As-Salaamu 'Alaiekum wa Rahmatul Laah"(peace be on you
                    and Allah's mercy) turning the face first towards the right
                    side and then towards the left. Now two Rak'ahs' prayer is
                    over.

                    (Attahyaat) and offer the remaining Rak'ah(s) which he has
                    to say. He should recite only Surah Faateha in the remaining
                    Rak'ah(s) of Fard prayer, but in case of Sunnat, Nafil and
                    Waajib, Surah Fateha has to be followed by any other Surah
                    or minimum three verses.

                    does not have to recite Surah Faateha and any other Surah or
                    verses and even not to recite Ta'awuz and Tasmiyah. He has
                    only to recite Sanaa and then to be quiet. While rising from
                    Rukoo he should say "Allaa-humma Rabbanaa wa Lakal-Hamd or

                    and placing the insides of three toes of each foot is Waajib
                    (essential). Prayer is invalid if one only touches his toes
                    with the ground or keeps them off the ground. Unfortunately,
                    most of us are not aware of such essentials of prayer.
